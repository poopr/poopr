😖 😩 💩 🤢

## Sales pitch
Poopr is like 🚖, but for 💩.

Imagine you are at a [crowded street festival](http://www.cphdistortion.dk/) and after a few beers, you suddenly have to go! You are far from home, and you certainly won't use the filthy public toilets. Maybe you could use the restroom in one of the many apartments nearby. 

What if I told you: "There is an app for that!"

Introducing Poopr! A *meticulously designed* app, part of the sharing economy, potentially leveraging [blockchain technologies](https://github.com/poopr/poopr/issues/5).
Now anyone can rent out their bathroom with just the click of a button. 
And anyone with urgent needs can look up nearby bathrooms, ready to be shared.
It is a match made in heaven.


## Install development environment
1) Install [node package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
